This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
print("Hello World",quote=FALSE)
```

```{r}
widget = c(3,0,10,-4,0.5)
widget ^ widget
```

Our first plot.
```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y = c(1, 8, 27, 64, 125)
plot(x, y, main="Our first R plot!",
     xlab = "Integers 1-5",
     ylab = "Integers 1-5 cubed")
```
We can always use `install.packages()` to install new packages.

We will use `install.packages("datasets")` to get datasets available.

We will then load that library as follows: `library(datasets)`.

We want to get `data(faithful)` so we can do the following plot:

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("faithful")
plot(faithful, main="Old Faithful Eruptions",
     xlab = "Eruption length (min)",
     ylab = "Wait time (min)", pch=20, col="red")
```

Now just the data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("faithful")
faithful
```

# Histogram

```{r}
hist(faithful$waiting, main="Histogram of faithful waiting",
     xlab = "Wait time (mins)",
     ylab = "Frequency")
```

Look to see where the breaks are in the data:

```{r}
# breaks in the dataset
hist(faithful$waiting, plot=FALSE)$breaks
hist(faithful$waiting, plot=FALSE)$counts

```

Creating a histogram with bin size = 1.  We would use the following code:
```{r}
hist(faithful$waiting,main="Histogram",
     breaks=seq(from=40,to=100,by=1))
```

```{r}
# Breaks
hist(faithful$waiting,
     breaks = seq(from=40,to=100,by=1), plot=FALSE)$breaks

# Counts
hist(faithful$waiting,
     breaks=seq(from=40,to=100,by=1), plot=FALSE)$counts
```
Making a QQ Plot
```{r}
x = rnorm(300)
qqnorm(x,pch=16,cex=.5)
qqline(x)
```
Let's do a QQ plot for the Old Faithful Waiting data.

```{r}
qqnorm(faithful$waiting,pch=16,cex=.5,
       main = "Q-Q Plot for Waiting Time")

qqline(faithful$waiting)
```
What we take from this, relative to our simulated normal data in the prior QQ plot, is that the Old Faithful Wait Times are not normally distributed.

Looking a variation from the normal line in simulated data.

```{r}
x = rnorm(30); qqnorm(x); qqline(x)
```
Even this line has data that pulls away from the normal line.

How does sample size impact this?  Let's look at a larger sample.

```{r}
x = rnorm(100); qqnorm(x,pch=16,cex=.5); qqline(x)
```

## Gotchas!

Don't write over built-in functions like `mean`, `c`, or `t`.

You can guard against this by doing `?var_name`.

See below:
```{r}
?mean
```
 
When we run that code in the help window on the right, we see the definition of the variable.  Similar to the others listed above.
